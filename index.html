				<h3 class="text-center">These are some facts on DOTA 2</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Axe became a general in the army by decapitating most of his superiors. By the time he was done there were no troops left to lead. He is now a one man army.</li>
					<li>Axe, Disruptor, Warlock and Lifestealer are part of the same race, Oglodi.</li>
					<li>An unspecified amount of dead gods reside in Sven's sword.</li>
					<li>Pudge was tasked with dismembering and disemboweling dead bodies to clear a cursed battlefield post-skirmish. At some point he became a cannibalistic psychopath.</li>
					<li>Sand King is the center of numerous rituals, including one where seven acolytes are impaled with a ceremonial stinger tail.</li>
					<li>It is unclear if Kunkka is alive or dead.</li>
					<li>Slardar and Naga Siren used to be colleague security guards, but Naga was fired after someone stole a chalice on her watch.</li>
					<li>Wraith King used to keep himself busy by creating a palace from the remains of his enemies, until he realised bones make for shoddy construction material.</li>
					<li>Clockwerk used to be a clockmaker, until his village got ransacked and his father told him with his dying breath to make war, not clocks.</li>
					<li>Clockwerk, Tinker, Sniper, Gyrocopter, Alchemist and Timbersaw all belong to the same race. Techies probably belong there as well.</li>
