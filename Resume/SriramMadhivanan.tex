	\begin{cvsection}{Technical Experience}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Projects}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Acceleration of Huffman Coding using MPI and CUDA} (C, MPI, CUDA). Implemented Huffman coding using CUDA and MPI to achieve scalable speedup for compression and decompression in a proprietary file format. Obtained maximum speedup of 13.5 and 15 with MPI and MPI-CUDA implementations respectively.
				\item \textbf{Sound Device Driver} (C, Assembly). Designed a Linux kernel device driver for the sound blaster 16 card. Tested by playing a raw sound file.
				\item \textbf{Graphics Device Driver} (C).  Implemented a device driver for PCI graphics card in Linux 4.3.3 to draw triangles using FIFO as well as DMA facility.
				\item \textbf{Data Driven 2D Game} (C++, SDL1.2).  Created a data driven 2D game of fighter genre with option of pvp or pvAI. Used Singleton, factory, strategy, flyweight and observer patterns.
				\item \textbf{Kakuro Solver} (Python). Implemented a solver for the kakuro puzzle in python using object oriented programming.The design lists all possible solutions. Solution is obtained by reducing the possible combinations based on the intersection information.
				\item \textbf{Acceleration of Kalman Filtering using OpenCL for FPGAs} (C, OpenCL). Developed a hardware solution to accelerate a 2D Kalman filter using OpenCL. Certain portions were successfully accelerated, but the overall design was slower than the CPU implementation.
